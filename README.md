**Author Collaboration Prediction using Graph Neural Networks**


# ðŸ“˜ Project Proposal

**Course:** Machine Learning with Graphs
**Semester:** [Fall 2025]
**Student Name(s):**

* Vivek Kumar (22372)
* Shrey Srivastava (22303)
* Manjul Chaturvedi (22194)
* Harsh Shukla (22140)

## 2. Introduction & Motivation

Research collaborations are central to scientific progress, fostering knowledge exchange and innovation. Predicting potential collaborations can reveal hidden academic communities and recommend promising coauthors.

Since coauthorship naturally forms a graph structure â€” authors as nodes and collaborations as edges â€” **graph-based machine learning** offers a powerful framework to address this problem through link prediction.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

We aim to predict **future or potential collaborations** between authors using a coauthorship graph. Given an existing network, the task is to identify pairs of authors most likely to collaborate, even if they currently lack a direct link.

---

## 4. Expected Outcomes

* A trained model recommending potential collaborators for authors.
* Quantitative comparison between heuristic, embedding, and GNN methods.
* Visualizations of networks and predicted collaboration links.
* Insights into structural and semantic factors driving collaborations.

## 6. Future Plans

We plan to extend the network into a **heterogeneous graph** of authors and papers, where papers include **Word2Vec embeddings** of their titles and introductions. This will allow the model to suggest not only new collaborators but also **relevant papers for an authorâ€™s research interests**.

Further, **hyperparameters** will enable controlling link predictions â€” such as focusing on **specific subgraphs** (e.g., by region or field) or restricting predictions to localized neighborhoods for more fine-grained recommendations.
