## 1. Project Title

**Author Collaboration Prediction using Graph Neural Networks**

---

## 2. Introduction & Motivation

Research collaborations are central to scientific progress, fostering knowledge exchange and innovation. Predicting potential collaborations can reveal hidden academic communities and recommend promising coauthors.

Since coauthorship naturally forms a graph structureâ€”authors as nodes and collaborations as edgesâ€”**graph-based machine learning** offers a powerful framework to address this problem through link prediction.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

We aim to predict **future or potential collaborations** between authors using a coauthorship graph. Given an existing network, the task is to identify pairs of authors most likely to collaborate, even if they currently lack a direct link.

---

## 4. Expected Outcomes

* A trained model recommending potential collaborators for authors.
* Quantitative comparison between heuristic, embedding, and GNN methods.
* Visualizations of networks and predicted collaboration links.
* Insights into structural and semantic factors driving collaborations.

## 5. Timeline (Work Plan)

| Week | Task                                       | Deliverable            |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1â€“2  | Literature review                          | Short survey document  |
| 3â€“4  | Dataset collection + preprocessing         | Clean coauthor dataset |
| 5â€“7  | Implement baselines (heuristics, Node2Vec) | Baseline results       |
| 8â€“9  | Implement GNN models (GAE, GraphSAGE, GAT) | Initial predictions    |
| 10   | Experiments + model tuning                 | Performance comparison |
| 11   | Final analysis, visualization, insights    | Draft report           |
| 12   | Presentation & submission                  | Final report + slides  |

## 6. Future Plans

We plan to extend the network into a **heterogeneous graph** of authors and papers, where papers include **Word2Vec embeddings** of their titles and introductions. This will allow the model to suggest not only new collaborators but also **relevant papers for an authorâ€™s research interests**.

Further, **hyperparameters** will enable controlling link predictionsâ€”such as focusing on **specific subgraphs** (e.g., by region or field) or restricting predictions to localized neighborhoods for more fine-grained recommendations.
